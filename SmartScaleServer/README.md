# SmartScaleServer
 Django server for recieving and transmitting information to smart scales.

This server runs on the django platform which can be installed at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/install/

Once install you will also need to install the libraries using the command
-pip install -r requirements.txt

You will also need a file call private.py in the SmartScaleServer directory, this file should contain the four variables:
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY, USERNAME, PASSWORD, MONGO_URL

DJANGO_SECRET_KET is required (can be generated by many websites)
USERNAME, PASSWORD, MONGO_URL is login information for the Mongo atlas server this is not needed if you change the database option in the settings.py file in the SmartScaleServer directory (uncomment the default sqlite3 database and comment to the mongo db)

To then create the database run
-python3 manage.py makemigrations
-python3 manage.py migrate

And to run the server on an open port so the scales and app can connect over the local Wi-Fi / internet
-python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

For connection please also add the host computers ip to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list in SmartScaleServer/settings.py
